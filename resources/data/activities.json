In this route close to the capital which can be easily reached, you can climb and even try a simple climb to move along a ridge from which you can see the\u00a0best views of the capital, the isthmus, and the cliffs of the north of Gran Canaria. From the\u00a0top, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re almost flying\u2026 before descending a ravine where you\u2019ll be able to initiate yourself in descents by doing a\u00a015-meter rappel.No previous experience in climbing or rappelling is necessary, only some skill in moving on mountain routes.
