In this route close to the capital which can be easily reached, you can climb and even try a simple climb to move along a ridge from which you can see the\u00a0best views of the capital, the isthmus, and the cliffs of the north of Gran Canaria. From the\u00a0top, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re almost flying\u2026 before descending a ravine where you\u2019ll be able to initiate yourself in descents by doing a\u00a015-meter rappel.No previous experience in climbing or rappelling is necessary, only some skill in moving on mountain routes. It is an ideal activity to lose your fear of heights or if you are curious about the mountain world beyond hiking. As a reward, a landscape dominated by the sea and all the geological history of Gran Canaria piled layer by layer on the cliffs.Meeting point: Under the bridge of Las Arenas:\u00a0https://goo.gl/maps/r3yZYdwafA9dSdgM8\u2013 Type of route: Circular\n\u2013 Physical level: Medium\n\u2013 Technical difficulty: Medium\n\u2013 Climbing level: IV\n\u2013 Maximum rappel height: 15 m- Distance: 4 km\n\u2013 Elevation gain: +/- 250 m\n\u2013 Duration: 3-4 hours",
